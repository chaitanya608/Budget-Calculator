# Budget-Calculator
Renders a web page that calculates budget based on user given list of incomes and expenses.

Main learning areas of this project are:
* organizing the whole project into semantic modules based on the project architecture, so as to write clean and understandable code.
* working with IIFEs to protect data from being accessed from outside the scope of a function
* working with closures so that only limited amount of data can be exposed to outer scope and be accessed by other modules.
* working with objects, prototypes and constructore functions so as to create appropriate data structure
* working with event listeners and event object in order to add functionality to buttons and input fields
* working with DOM so as to create user friendly UI and allow user to manipulate data on the web page.
